I can't\nSince honesty is the best policy I'll give you the old college try\nTry to acknowledge my mistakes, probably won't qualify\nAs a gentleman and a scholar, but it's time that I swallow pride\nAnd say that I'm sorry, sorry I can't apologize\nI think of all them times I compromised my bottom lines\nAnd thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter's minds\nThen I'm like dollar signs\nBut I may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke\nIs more of a knockout than Janay Rice\nPlay nice, bitch, I'll punch Lana Del Rey right\nIn the face twice like Ray Rice in broad daylight\nIn plain sight of the elevator surveillance\nTil her head is banged on the railing\nThen celebrate with the Ravens\nNever date an assailant who self-medicates with inhalants\nI'd meditate, but I may need a better way to escape\nThe aggression, rage and the anger\nCause they restraints on the ankles\nHeavyweights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains\nThis ain't enough to contain it\nBut I still get the same respect as Jay if I came on\nStage in a fucking neglig\u00e9e everyday and Liz Claiborne\nDevastated from breakup with Kate Hudson\nWait slut, your friends, what are they gonna say\nCause makeup ain't gonna cover\nThat eye that's seven-eighths of the way shut\nPeppersprayed with your face cut\nMade my bank like a lay up\nOff these effing skanks on the way up\nOh, bitch thinks she's heaven-sent\nIt's evident that she ain't never been with seven inches\nYes, I said seven, I measured it\nSeven inches from the floor\nWhile I'm standing on the fourth floor balcony\nAt the Sheradon when I'm stretching it\nBitch, I'm a pimp so a limp dick is all you'll ever get\nSo if she's hesitant to get the hint\nI'll bet you that I get the message sent who she's messing with\nHella quick when I tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon\nWhen I step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench\nExistential detriments to a lesbian devil\nIn the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level\nThat separatists like a Chechnian rebel\nImpressionist with a pencil\nA pessimist, with his lips pressed against\nThe edge of this Red Bull\nPedal to the metal I'm rippin' this shit cause right away I'll give it to a bitch like a pedestrian, deadly as ever\nYou see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when I push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass\nSHADYXV as perplexing as\nThe last fifteen years and I'm predicting my next relapse\nWhen I spit these lyrics so don't look at me weird\nWhen I start shifting gears and shit re-smears all over Britney Spears\nAnd these little Disney queers\nWho use chicks for beards?\nJust made that up too...\nOh and the Shady 2.0\nWe wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the Super Bowls\nCause it's supposed to confuse you hoes\nThe flows lose you as usual, so juvenile\n2 year old when I go to the studio\nIt's only music but don't be foolish though\nYou don't know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though\nIn my homie's Buick\nBeen known to lose it though so if I overdo it you drove me to it\nWhen I step in the vocal booth like I'm supposed to do\nAnd I murder you on a fuckin' track like Tony Stewart\nIn one take, if I fuck up and I don't redo it\nYou couldn't sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it\nThe day I don't say fuck you (w)all, you can throw me through it\nRootinest-tootinest, shootin' this from the hip\nWith the sentiments, Eminem isn't penning them for the women\nI'm an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot\nBut they consider me equivalent to chlamydia\nThey tryna get rid of me gadzooks\nBut I stiggity stand for the fliggity flag\nOf the United States and the freedom, I distribute these raps through\nAnd if I catch you doing anything\nHindering or prohibiting that after I give me that\nTattoo of your lips on my ass I'mma be literally\nPickin' up and deliberately whippin' the Statue of Liberty at you WOOOOH!\n\nFuck it\n\nGot it somewhere in there probably"},

I just don't know...\n\nSo I take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ah\nA couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high\nNow I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by\nWouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die\nOh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use\nThere's new rules it's cool if it's helping you to get through\nIt's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze\nWhat else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?\nNow here I am three months later full blown relapse\nJust get high until the kids get home from school homes relax\nAnd since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take 3 naps\nJust to be able to function throughout the day let's see\nThat's an Ambien each nap how many Valium? Three.\nAnd that will average out to about one good hours sleep\nOK, so now you see the reason how come he\nHas taken four years just to put out an album beat\nSee me and you we almost had the same outcome heath\nCause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing\nIt was Bologna was it the methadone ya think\nOr the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos\nYour VCR tape cases with you Ambient CR great places to hide ain't it\nSo you can lie to Hallie\nI'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Alaina\nGo in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance\nThey said they found me on the bathroom floor... Damn\n\nSometimes I feel so alone,\nI just don't know,\nFeels like I been down this road before,\nSo lonely and cold,\nIt's like something takes over me,\nSoon as I go home and close the door.\nKinda feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nI wanna get away from this place I do.\nBut I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't.\nAnd why?

Oh, there goes gravity\nOh, there goes Rabbit, he choked\nHe's so mad, but he won't give up that\nEasy, no\nHe won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes\nIt don't matter, he's dope\nHe knows that but he's broke\nHe's so sad that he knows\nWhen he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's\nBack to the lab again, yo\nThis whole rhapsody\nHe better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him\n\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music, the moment\nYou own it, you better never let it go (go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime (yo)\nYou better lose yourself in the music, the moment\nYou own it, you better never let it go (go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime (yo)\n(You better)\n\nThe soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping\nThis world is mine for the taking\nMake me king, as we move toward a new world order\nA normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to postmortem\nIt only grows harder, homie grows hotter\nHe blows. It's all over. These hoes is all on him\nCoast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter\nLonely roads, God only knows\nHe's grown farther from home, he's no father\nHe goes home and barely knows his own daughter\nBut hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water\nHis hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product\nThey moved on to the next schmoe who flows\nHe nose dove and sold nada\nSo the soap opera is told and unfolds\nI suppose it's old partner, but the beat goes on\nDa da dum da dum da da da da\n\n\n\nNo more games, I'mma change what you call rage\nTear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged\nI was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed\nI've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage\nBut I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher\nBest believe somebody's paying the Pied Piper\nAll the pain inside amplified by the\nFact that I can't get by with my 9 to 5\nAnd I can't provide the right type of life for my family\n'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers\nAnd it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life\nAnd these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder\nTrying to feed and water my seed, plus\nTeeter totter caught up between being a father and a primadonna\nBaby, mama drama's screaming on her\nToo much for me to wanna\nStay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me\nTo the point, I'm like a snail\nI've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot\nSuccess is my only motherfucking option, failure's not\nMom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go\nI cannot grow old in Salem's lot\nSo here I go it's my shot.\nFeet, fail me not\nThis may be the only opportunity that I got\n\n\n\nYou can do anything you set your mind to, man"},

It's laughable\n'Cause me and love's like a bad combination I keep them feelings locked in a vault, so it's safe to say I'm uncrackable\nMy heart is truly guarded\nFull body armor bitch, you just need a helmet 'cause if you think you special, you're retarded\nThinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina\nYou're a trainwreck, I got a one-track mind and, shorty, you're fine but you sorta remind me of a 49'er\n'Cause you've been a gold digger since you was a miner\nBeen tryin' to hunt me down like a dog 'cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent\n'Cause all of my spare time's spent\nOn my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'\nOnly women that I love are my daughters, but sometimes I rhyme\nAnd it sounds like I forget I'm a father and I push it farther, so, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line\nIt's apparent I shouldn't have been parent I'll never grow up, so to Hell with your parents and 'mother' fuck 'father' time\nIt ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime\nSo even if I'm half-dead, I'm half alive\nPoured my half-empty glass in a cup now my cup has runneth over\nAnd I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster\nI'm goin' back to what got me here, yeah cocky and\nCan't knock bein' Rudolph, so fear not my deer\nAnd dry up your tear drops I'm here\nWhite America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird\nIf you stare at me and see yourself, 'cause you're one too, shouldn't be a shock be\n'Cause everybody knows"},

That you coulda bet your asses\nIf I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them\nAnd although one has only met their grandma once\nYou pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers\nMe, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you\nAnd as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me\nAs we pulled off to go our separate paths,\nAnd I saw your headlights as I looked back\nAnd I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad\nSo, Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet\nI guess I had to get this off my chest,\nI hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead\nThe stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing\nSo if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar\n'Cause you're my Ma\n\n\n\n\nI want a new life (start over)\nOne without a cause (clean slate)\nSo I'm coming home tonight (yeah)\nWell, no matter what the cost\nAnd if the plane goes down\nOr if the crew can't wake me up\nWell, just know that I'm alright\nI was not afraid to die\nOh, even if there's songs to sing\nWell, my children will carry me\nJust know that I'm alright\nI was not afraid to die\nBecause I put my faith in my little girls\nSo I never say, \"Goodbye, cruel world.\"\nJust know that I'm alright\nI am not afraid to die\n\n\n\nI want a new life"},
