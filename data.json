chainsaws\nOr run through hell with a pair of gasoline Hanes on\nI'm a star but not on some I wanna be a star kinda shit\nThe only celebrity that give a fuck less than me is Marshawn Lynch\nGlock in the stash as a backup but the MAC'll burst\nCripple your style, your first born child'll come out\nWith a colostomy bag as the afterbirth\nI don't give a fuck\nNigga I'll show up to Beyonce's show posin' as Jay Z\nStagger in your studio session with a bomb strapped to my chest\nLookin' like Omarion holdin' his baby\nJump in the 4 door Mercedes with a .44 listenin' to JoJo and K-Ci\nDrinkin' and sniffin' enough blow that it got me thinkin' I can exchange sicknesses\nMaybe, this ebola for rabies\nThat's it, just livin' the rapper life\nBanana clip in the air, lookin' like it's 'bout to start singin' it's MAC tonight\nMACs, I use this MAC as a component for thugs rollin' up\nI got this MAC on and you better stay in that corner\nCause shit can turn into that song except I don't give a fuck what day it is\nI'll have this club goin' up, fuck with me\nMack magnet, attractin' enormous green\nSlap this clip in this gat then call this arm Christy Mack\nCause this bitch is that war machine\nLife of a giant, but who needs size when you're wack and your team's soft\nDrag your girl down this hill 'til she admits that it feels like she's jackin' the beanstalk\nWe both got marketing plans\nYours is to sell records and try to net more than you gross before\nMine is to punch you in your face if you ever disrespect me\nAnd then go invest into a grocery store\nRolled up with the Smith & Wesson and drew on you like let's fight now\nI do numbers, I turn you and your crew into two plumbers\nTranslation, get your shit together and pipe down\nFuck a mic, I don't write, I chew and spit\nI'll shoot you and your sis if you insist\nI got my eyes on the sparrow\nSilencer's so big it look like I got Bobby Shmurda tied to the front of the barrel\nAnd he doin' this\n\n\n(My name is Marshall\nI'm repping that motherfucking Motor City, bitch)\nI just turned Slaughterhouse to a quintet\nBegan to trend-set, murdered a friend's pet\nMade shit as ill as it can get went in depth\nLike a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet\nI'm already covered in sweat and I wasn't even ready to come in yet\nAHH, let me set this drink down\nBeat up a gal, start beef with her pal\nProbably be wild 'til I'm wrinkled and senile\nAnd \"Rap God\" was a freestyle\nOff the top of the dome piece while I was sleep on the couch\nAnd I'm freestyling now\nI need a towel, sweat leaks from my brow\nIt's burning my eyes, my cerebral is foul\nCause shit I'm thinking about should be illegal\nI need my head banned like the guy who left Cleveland Ohio\nAnd went to South Beach with his talents\nScream \"fuck you\" on the way out and wink with a smile\nThis whole game can eat a dick, I'm going back deep underground\nBut right now I'm back on that bullshit and you I'm singling out\nCause you're so fucking outdated you should mingle a while\nWhat the fuck is this Klusterfuk of busters\nBunch of Buster Douglas', motherfuckers is one hit wonders\nOne swing and you're crowned\nKnocked one out the park, one catchy jingle and now\nYou think you fucking with me cause you sold like 300 thou\nBitch, I can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground\nReach up, swing from a cloud with 3 thousand people around\nEvil and vile enough to leap in the crowd\nAnd heave a child in a sink hole on Cinco De Mayo\nWhen I'm sprinkled in pico de gallo\nMardi Gras beads in a towel\nI just made that up\nI don't know much Spanish, I'm not bilingual\nBut I'll show you a Mexican stand off\nBetween just these two amigos\nCause neither really wants to say what we're thinking out loud\nBut I sure as fuck think I know how read body English, no doubt\nCause we're trying to kill each other, but lyrically\nThe fuck is humility? What is a real emcee?\nRoyce, he came up in the shit with me\nNever spit that hustler shit, it wasn't a fit for me\nLet them adjust 'til they just get the gist of me\nJust not giving a fuck and plus with the history\nOf muscular distrophy, it wasn't a mystery\nWhy this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning\nSo what in the fuck is a list to me?\nI'm used to not being on it, I expect it out 'em\nHeck wit' em, I get my respect without 'em\nAin't really been into diamonds since I put my first record out\nBut I could put a chain around my second album\nAnd wear it as a neck medallion\nBecame a millionaire, went downhill from there\nBecame civil, office swivel chair, sterling silverware\nScreaming life is still unfair til I get a real career\nThe fuck am I gonna do until then? This job is too fulfilling\nTwo ga-jillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in\nAnd a mood to kill till I plow my Coupe de Ville\nInto some children at the food pavilion and Build-A-Bear\nWarrior's mind, I\u2019m pro-hydrocodone euphoria\nIn the Drug Emporium line, I'm soaring\nI'm pouring Vicodin four at the time ignoring the warning signs on 'em fore I go four wheeler riding\nGory and violent and horrifying\nYou surely won't find no one more appalling\nThan I am with this retaliatorial rhyming for Gloria Steinem\nBut I finger her like a witness, show me a line-up\nI usually am abusive, but excuse me, ma'am\nI guess I must've threw you for a loop like Toucan Sam\nWhen I said I could use the sample cause you's a tramp\nBut look how you react to this trigger like\nWhen I call you a bigger dyke than the Hoover Dam\nYou're playing right in Lex Luthor's hand\nIt's such a ruthless plan, might even lose a fan\nBut fuck it, Superman wouldn't change in a phone booth for Stan\nI'm a brand new being like Grand Puba's band\nHappy as Anderson Cooper having a tuba crammed\nIn his pooper with lubricant...wait, that's too... I can't\nSince honesty is the best policy I'll give you the old college try\nTry to acknowledge my mistakes, probably won't qualify\nAs a gentleman and a scholar, but it's time that I swallow pride\nAnd say that I'm sorry, sorry I can't apologize\nI think of all them times I compromised my bottom lines\nAnd thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter's minds\nThen I'm like dollar signs\nBut I may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke\nIs more of a knockout than Janay Rice\nPlay nice, bitch, I'll punch Lana Del Rey right\nIn the face twice like Ray Rice in broad daylight\nIn plain sight of the elevator surveillance\nTil her head is banged on the railing\nThen celebrate with the Ravens\nNever date an assailant who self-medicates with inhalants\nI'd meditate, but I may need a better way to escape\nThe aggression, rage and the anger\nCause they restraints on the ankles\nHeavyweights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains\nThis ain't enough to contain it\nBut I still get the same respect as Jay if I came on\nStage in a fucking neglig\u00e9e everyday and Liz Claiborne\nDevastated from breakup with Kate Hudson\nWait slut, your friends, what are they gonna say\nCause makeup ain't gonna cover\nThat eye that's seven-eighths of the way shut\nPeppersprayed with your face cut\nMade my bank like a lay up\nOff these effing skanks on the way up\nOh, bitch thinks she's heaven-sent\nIt's evident that she ain't never been with seven inches\nYes, I said seven, I measured it\nSeven inches from the floor\nWhile I'm standing on the fourth floor balcony\nAt the Sheradon when I'm stretching it\nBitch, I'm a pimp so a limp dick is all you'll ever get\nSo if she's hesitant to get the hint\nI'll bet you that I get the message sent who she's messing with\nHella quick when I tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon\nWhen I step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench\nExistential detriments to a lesbian devil\nIn the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level\nThat separatists like a Chechnian rebel\nImpressionist with a pencil\nA pessimist, with his lips pressed against\nThe edge of this Red Bull\nPedal to the metal I'm rippin' this shit cause right away I'll give it to a bitch like a pedestrian, deadly as ever\nYou see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when I push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass\nSHADYXV as perplexing as\nThe last fifteen years and I'm predicting my next relapse\nWhen I spit these lyrics so don't look at me weird\nWhen I start shifting gears and shit re-smears all over Britney Spears\nAnd these little Disney queers\nWho use chicks for beards?\nJust made that up too...\nOh and the Shady 2.0\nWe wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the Super Bowls\nCause it's supposed to confuse you hoes\nThe flows lose you as usual, so juvenile\n2 year old when I go to the studio\nIt's only music but don't be foolish though\nYou don't know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though\nIn my homie's Buick\nBeen known to lose it though so if I overdo it you drove me to it\nWhen I step in the vocal booth like I'm supposed to do\nAnd I murder you on a fuckin' track like Tony Stewart\nIn one take, if I fuck up and I don't redo it\nYou couldn't sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it\nThe day I don't say fuck you (w)all, you can throw me through it\nRootinest-tootinest, shootin' this from the hip\nWith the sentiments, Eminem isn't penning them for the women\nI'm an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot\nBut they consider me equivalent to chlamydia\nThey tryna get rid of me gadzooks\nBut I stiggity stand for the fliggity flag\nOf the United States and the freedom, I distribute these raps through\nAnd if I catch you doing anything\nHindering or prohibiting that after I give me that\nTattoo of your lips on my ass I'mma be literally\nPickin' up and deliberately whippin' the Statue of Liberty at you WOOOOH!\n\nFuck it\n\nGot it somewhere in there probably", "year": null, "album": null, "title": "SHADY CXVPHER"}
